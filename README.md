A full HTML5 Web App with a PHP based AJAX server that works as a 
base template for HTML5/CSS3 app using jQuery.Update and go. Client & PHP Server.

This HTML5 PHP App template is ES2015+ compliant, will run in all browsers natively without the need for any "compiler" or 3rd party pre-processing solution (Babel, Node, Broswerify, etc NOT required).

Fully ES2015 compatible JS Objects with AJAX samples using fetch, async/await and JQuery post/get

Modern browsers continue to evolve and extend the basic functionality and as of ES2017 full module suport, class (style) based inheritance, scoping are all available to make it easy for non JavaScript programmers to get into JavaScript.

This HTML5 PHP App also uses CSS3 Grid Layouts with Flexbox.

Application's HTML5 Structure: All the "wrapper" is in a form of CSS GRID Layout. Each grid "area" has a "container" in a form of "flexbox". And each flexbox "container" contains "flexitems".

All of the traditional, functional traits of JavaScript are mantained but made easier to access as beginners and programmers coming from other languages.

Enjoy this base template.
